# Pomodoro Pal


This project is aimed at creating a website that helps the user manage their time. It will implement the pomodoro technique and allow the user to create their own notes and flashcards.


## What is the pomodoro technique?

The pomodoro method is used to divide up time for work and time for breaks and creativity.

- Choose a task to work on and document it.
- Set the pomodoro timer to 25 minutes.
- Work on the task until the time is up and take a 5 minute break.
- After four 25 minute intervals with 5 minute breaks, take a 10 minute break.
- During the breaks, the user is encouraged to do something creative.


This method helps with time management, focus, and productivity. The goals of the website are to provide the user with a settings menu to adjust the pomodoro timer, to allow the user to enter notes, and to let them create flashcards to study. They would need to have a login to be able to save their work.
